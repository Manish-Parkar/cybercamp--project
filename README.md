# Weather API using Python
This is my second python project which I have completed during my 7 Day Long Python and Cybersecurity Bootcamp. In this project, I have created a python code that displays the current weather conditions of any city in the world using a weather API key from OpenWeatherMap and some basic python libraries such as requests and datetime, and at last, I have saved all this weather report of a particular city in a text file using the python build function open() for writing the weather info in a text file.
